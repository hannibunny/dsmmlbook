    "* Contents of this course will be tought task-driven. This means that we start from the tasks of the [Live coding exercise-notebooks](#livecoding). In order to solve these tasks theory and programming skills are required from the notebooks in chapter [Data Mining with Python](#data_mining). We will consult these notebooks whenever we require the corresponding skills to solve the tasks of the exercise notebooks. "

If the data used for training the transformer shall be transformed immediately after training, the *.fit_transform(data)*-method can be applied.\n",
    "* All Machine Learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning belong to the **Estimator** class, e.g. *LogisticRegression, SVM, MLP, Kmeans*, etc. These estimators are trained by applying the *.fit(trainfeatures)*- or *.fit(trainfeatures,trainlabels)*-method. The former configuration is applied for unsupervised-, the latter for supervised learning. Once an estimator is trained, it can be applied for clustering, classification or regression by envoking the *.predict(data)*-method. \n",
